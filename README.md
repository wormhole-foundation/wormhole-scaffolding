# Apps for `worm init`

Starter apps to be used with worm cli.

## Prerequisites

### EVM

If your xChain app will require EVM smart contracts, we recommend using [Foundry tools](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), which include `forge`, `anvil` and `cast` CLI tools.

### Solana

If your xChain app will require Solana programs, prepare your development environment by installing [Solana and Anchor dependencies](https://book.anchor-lang.com/getting_started/installation.html), which include `solana` and `anchor` CLI tools.

## Getting Started walkthrough

1. [Hello World](01_hello_world.md)
   - A simple set of programs employing Wormhole's universal messaging to transmit an arbitrary message, that can be verified by any contract after integrating with Wormhole core Instructions. 
2. [Hello Token](02_hello_token.md)
   - A simple network of contracts that use Wormhole's token bridge contracts to perform cross-chain token transfer with an arbitrary payload [(contract-controlled transfers)](https://book.wormhole.com/technical/evm/tokenLayer.html?highlight=contract-controlled#contract-controlled-transfer) which any of the registered contracts can consume after using 'registerEmitter' function.
